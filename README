The program is a file censoring tool.
It accepts command-line arguments for a filename, a string to censor, and a
replacement character. The program utilizes memory mapping to efficiently 
search for occurrences of the specified string in the file and replaces them 
with the given character. It then syncs the modified file to disk and releases 
the memory mapping.

input: 
Filename: The name of the file that needs to be censored.
String to Censor: The specific string that should be replaced or
censored in the file.
Replacement Character: The character that will be used to substitute 
the censored string in the file.

output:
The program modifies the specified file by replacing occurrences of
the given string with the provided replacement character, and then saves the 
modified file to disk.

Compile: gcc -Wall ex4a.c -o ex4a

Run: ./ex4a "file name" "string to censor" "replacement character"
